# Inflamed-Cochlea-Cell-Classifier

## Project Description
This project developed a software application to facilitate the study of cochlear fibrocytes inflammation from a high dimensional Raman spectroscopy dataset. The software aimed to provide an interactive visualisation of Raman spectra and apply Principal Component Analysis to extract key features from the dataset. Additionally, six machine learning techniques are offered by the software to preform classification on new data, including Self-Organizing Map (SOM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost, and Support Vector Classification (SVC).

## Files Description
. 'Main.py': The main python file to open the software, allowing users to navigate and interact the application.
. 'GUI_Element.py': This python file contains all the Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements, and they can be recalled on every page of the software.
. 'DataProcessing.py': This file contains script to clean, extract features, and apply machine learning methods to the imported data.
